Package: IMVA
Title: Interactive Exploratory Multivariate Analysis Shiny app
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: "Henry Castellanos <henrycastellanos5@gmail.com> [aut,cre]"
Description: This app was inspired by the FactoShiny package which implements           	multivariate analysis (unsupervised learning / data mining) methods: 		Principal Component Analysis, Cluster Analysis and Multiple Correspondence 		Analysis from the FactoMineR package in a shiny application. In turn, this 		app implements multivariate analysis methods from the FactoMineR package with 	interactive output plots and data objects in addition to reactivity from user 	inputs typical of a shiny app.
